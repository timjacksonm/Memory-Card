## Summary

Memory card game! I drew inspiration for the characters from one of my favorite racing games 'Crash Team Racing'. I focused on using what I learned about react hooks and implementing them into this project. I created my own Characters.js component which houses all my character data that I use throughout my app instead of using an API. Hardest part for me was figuring out how to update the state of my characterList. It is an array of 55 objects (characters). I did mess around with tailwindcss some but decided not to use it as I had already coded most of the styling in raw css. Overall I am happy with the outcome I hope you enjoy!
